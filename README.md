# mtm6201-final

## Overview

This project is my final portfolio website for MTM6201 course. The website has been built using Bootstrap framework and showcases my works as a web designer and developer. It is a responsive site that can be accessed on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Process

### Planning and Design
To begin with, I design high-fidelity mockups for mobile, tablet, and desktop versions of the three pages of interest- **Home**, **About**, and **Contact**.These designs are aimed to offer a consistent user experience across all devices by focusing on accessibility, aesthetics, and usability. These design files are placed in the designs folder within this repository under /designs-mobile,/designs-tablet,/designs-desktop representing its three breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop). 

### Development
After approving designs, I made mtm6201-final in GitHub repository then I cloned it to my local machine. I used Bootstrap framework, utilizing its grid system, breakpoints, and components to implement the designs. To meet design requirements other than those specified by Bootstrap defaults, I included custom CSS.

Key features implemented include:
- **Responsive Layouts:** Bootstrap’s grid system was utilized, resulting in the website being able to adapt to any screen size.
- **Accessibility:** The site was developed with accessibility in mind, incorporating alt text for images, ARIA roles, skip links, and other attributes to assist users with disabilities.
- **Optimized Images:** Images were optimized and responsive, using the `<picture>` element with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes to ensure appropriate images are loaded based on the device's screen size.
- **Hover and Focus States:** ll interactive elements, such as links and buttons, have hover and focus states with smooth transitions to enhance user experience.

### Challenges and Solutions
One of the primary challenges I had was making sure that the designs were correctly carried out in the Bootstrap framework while the website responsiveness was maintained on a lot of different devices. Another area where I was required to sustain my visualization was the need to adjust the Bootstrap variables that come with a default CSS theme.

To overcome these challenges:
- I carefully planned and organized the CSS using variables to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy.
- I leveraged Bootstrap’s documentation and community resources to better understand and implement customizations effectively.

### Lessons Learned
This project gave me the hands-on experience of developing a fully responsive and accessible website from scratch using the Bootstrap framework. I deepened my understanding of Bootstrap’s grid system, responsive utilities, and how to efficiently customize a Bootstrap-based site with custom CSS. Additionally, I learned the importance of maintaining a structured workflow, from design to development, and the value of detailed planning to avoid common pitfalls during development.
